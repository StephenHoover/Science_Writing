# 2.2 Write a short article

## Step One: Identify the Key Story Points for your Work.

* For each question, write a short paragraph — no more than two to three sentences. These identify the essential story elements.

### 1. What is your opening? 
  * This should identify the larger problem to which you are contributing, give readers a sense of the direction your paper is going, and make it clear why it is important. It should engage the widest audience practical.

### 2. What is your specific question or hypothesis?

### 3. What are the key results of your work? Identify these in a short list. 
  * There should be no more than two to three points.

### 4. What is your main conclusion? What did you learn about nature? 
  * This should use the results from section (3) to answer the question from (2), and
should address the larger problem identified in (1).

## Step Two: Write the Article

Write a short article describing your research. Your target audience is scientists
who are not specialists in your discipline. You are trying to tell the story of your
work and engage and educate your readers, not write a technical paper. The tone
can range between somewhat technical and more casual, but it must be something
that technical readers would find interesting. Use your answers from step one to
frame the story you write in this part of the exercise.

The word limit is strict: 800–850 words.

## Step three: Analyze your writing

Circulate your articles among your writers' group (a group of three to four people
seems ideal for this). Analyze and edit each other’s work. Th en discuss the articles.
Ask and answer the following questions:

### 1. What did the author do well? (It’s always good to start positive.)

### 2. Was the topic interesting? 
  * Was it cast at the right level and hit the right audience? 
  * Could you have rewritten it to engage a wider audience? 
  * Did it make you want to read the rest of the piece?

### 3. Was the specific question clear?

### 4. Were the results clear? Did they relate to the topic and the specific question?

### 5. Were the Conclusions true conclusions, or were they merely a restatement of the results? 
  * Did they relate to the large issues raised in the opening?
  * Did they answer the specific question asked? Did they clearly grow from the results presented in the piece?

### 6. What did you get as the "take-home" message of the story? Do you believe that this was the message the author was trying to give you?

### 7. Was the writing clear? If not, can you figure out why and identify ways to make it clearer?
